## 💡 Projects

### 🚦 [Smart Traffic Management System – Capstone Project](https://github.com/ali-51214/smart-traffic-system)
- Built an intelligent traffic signal system using YOLOv5 for vehicle detection.
- Used LoRa (RYLR modules) to transmit real-time lane data from Python (laptop) to an ESP32.
- ESP32 processed car counts and controlled LEDs based on traffic density.
- Implemented UART serial communication with AT command configuration.

### 🔵 **2. Custom USB-to-UART Converter (CH340 Based) — PCB Project**

A custom PCB designed to improve usability by adding a **USB-power LED indicator**, along with proper ESD and reverse-polarity protection.

#### **Key Components**
- **CH340** — USB-to-UART chip  
- **TVS Diode (TPD2EUSB30DRTR)** — ESD protection for D+ / D−  
- **Decoupling capacitors** — power stability  
- **LED indicator** — shows when USB is powered  
- **Reverse-polarity protection diodes**  
- Resistors for current regulation  

#### **What I Focused On**
- Routing high-speed USB data lines (impedance-aware layout)  
- Power stability considerations  
- Proper grounding strategy for USB protection  
- Complete Altium workflow: schematic → PCB layout → DRC → Gerbers
